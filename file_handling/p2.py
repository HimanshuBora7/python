#10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input 
#occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert 
#the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for 
#two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if 
#either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your 
#program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a 
#number
while True:

 try:
    x = int(input("enter the first number: "))
    y = int(input("enter the second number: "))
    result = x+y
    print(f"addition of two entered number is {result} ")
 except ValueError:
    print("please enter digit not texts ")
