#9-7. Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called 
#Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 162) 
#or Exercise 9-5 (page 167). Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list 
#of strings like "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on. 
#Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of 
#privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method

#from exercise 9-5
